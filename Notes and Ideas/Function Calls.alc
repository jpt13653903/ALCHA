// The function name could be an alias for the target:

sig`8 Add(sig`8 A, sig`8 B){
 Add = A + B;
}

sig`8 A, B, Y;
Y = Add(A, B);

// In clocked functions, the assignment is applied immediately, in the function.
// This is achieved by means of a multiplexer with a port for every function-
// call.
