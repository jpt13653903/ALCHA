// The function name could be an alias for the target:

net(8) Add(net(8) A, net(8) B){
  Add = A + B;
}

net(8) A, B, Y;
Y = Add(A, B);

// In clocked functions, the assignment is applied immediately, in the function.
// This is achieved by means of a multiplexer with a port for every function-
// call.
