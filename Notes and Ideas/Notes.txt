Bugs:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Todo:
- Mealy vs. Moore machine?
 - non-reset signals must go into a case-statement of its own to remove the 
   reset dependence.
 - In journal article, concentrate on common things often neglected by
   developers:
   - Pipelined reset
   - Reset dependence on signals that does not require resets

- Arrays have "a.length" and other properties.
  - Note this in the wiki
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes...
- Abstract the time between signals so that Alcha automatically generate the
  counters, etc. for something like the timing generator.
- For compiler: look at MD5 sum, not the modification date.
- For the PhD: take the case study design and break it up into components.  
  Fixed-point operations, streaming interfaces (with and without back-pressure), 
  register / control bus (i.e. memory-mapped PIO), clock domain crossing, etc...  
  Count the lines if code of each type of primitive, and how much it would save
  if the language provided built-in support...

- A class is a collection of instructions and members.  So is a namespace, but 
  a namespace is the instance, whereas a class must still be instanced...
- Strip out all the definitions and leave the AST

- Unit tests and contracts?

- External link on SourceForge to Google survey.

- Symbol table handles the name-spaces:
  - Use symbol table class methods to push / pop / etc.

- After D: Member functions are virtual by default.

- Always copy - never reference?
  - Except into a function, which is always pass-by-reference?

- If the LHS is not defined, define it based on the RHS type.  The resulting
  variable cannot be redefined as something else later.

- Functions are duck-typed and parameters are passed by reference.
  - Vector notation is handled automatically by the way the parameters are
    used.

- Clocked functions do not have to be within the calling state machine
  - They can be handled by means of a "busy" signal instead.  This might make
    the overall circuit smaller
  - The "busy" flag can be put around the whole state machine, so that it is
    routed to the clock-enable...
  
- Synthesisable recursive functions are legal, as long as they are
  declared with a "stacksize" attribute.
  - Combinational functions are fine without this attribute
  - Clocked functions must have this attribute.  The parameters and return
    state are then implemented in RAM of appropriate size.

- Can classes be used to abstract variables that are stored in external
  memory?

- How can classes be used to abstract streaming data?

- Location attribute for class instances:
  - Specify a rectangle consisting of normalised coordinates (P-Block in
    Xilinx)

- PLL-type clocks need a tolerance property:
  - You cannot get 133 MHz and 10 MHz out of the same PLL on older devices, 
    but if the 133 MHz is specified with a -3->+1 tolerance, the 
    ALCHA compiler can make it work.

- Clock groups:
  - All unrelated clocks must be grouped
  - See Xilinx UG903 - Vivado Using Constraints, page 47 for syntax
  - -include_generated_clocks makes it easier when the node names are not
    known.

- Is it possible to handle "don't care" conditions in if-statements and case
  statements?
