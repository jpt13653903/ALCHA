# ALCHA

A New Programming Language for FPGA Projects &ndash; currently in pre-alpha

## Summary

ALCHA aims to reduce FPGA project develop time by means of automation and abstraction,
but without loosing the low-level control that HDLs, such as Verilog, provide.

## Features

- Compile to complete vendor-specific project from largely vendor-neutral source
- Object oriented programming model
- Proceedural state-machine programming model
- Abstract data and signal types
- Compile-time scripting
- Automated timing-requirement generation
- Bit- and timing-accurate circuit description
